> Build me a production-ready Elixir/Phoenix Incident Response Platform with real-time LiveView dashboard. Here are the requirements:
>
> **Core Features:**
> - Log incidents with title, description, reporter, affected service, and severity
> - Auto-classify severity (P1–P4) based on keywords and affected service criticality
> - Track incident lifecycle: opened → acknowledged → investigating → mitigated → resolved
> - Calculate MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) per service and overall
> - Post incident notifications to Slack via webhook
> - Incident timeline/activity log (status changes, comments, assignments)
> - **Real-time LiveView dashboard** — incidents stream in live, status changes update instantly, MTTR gauges refresh automatically
>
> **Routes/Endpoints (6–8):**
> 1. `POST /api/incidents` — create a new incident (JSON API)
> 2. `GET /api/incidents` — list incidents with filters (status, severity, service, date range)
> 3. `GET /api/incidents/:id` — get incident detail with full timeline
> 4. `PATCH /api/incidents/:id` — update status, assign, add comment
> 5. `GET /api/metrics/mttr` — MTTR stats by service and severity
> 6. `POST /api/incidents/:id/notify` — trigger Slack notification
> 7. `GET /api/health` — health check endpoint
>
> **LiveView Pages:**
> - `/dashboard` — real-time incident board with live status updates, severity breakdown, active incident count, and MTTR gauges
> - `/incidents/:id` — live incident detail with streaming timeline (new comments, status changes appear instantly via PubSub)
> - `/incidents/new` — incident creation form with live severity preview based on keyword detection
>
> **Tech Stack:**
> - Elixir 1.17+ / Phoenix 1.7+ with Phoenix LiveView
> - PostgreSQL with Ecto + migrations
> - Phoenix PubSub for real-time broadcasts
> - Phoenix Token auth for API endpoints
> - Tailwind CSS (Phoenix default) for dashboard styling
> - Docker + docker-compose for local dev (app + postgres)
> - ExUnit tests
>
> **Project Structure:**
> Standard Phoenix project layout:
> ```
> lib/
>   incident_commander/        # domain/context layer
